   Positions computed with astronomy-engine (geocentric, true
   equator & equinox of date). Lines are computed at runtime
   from RA/Dec + Greenwich sidereal time at the birth moment:
   - MC line:  geographic longitude where the planet culminates
   - IC line:  the anti-meridian of the MC line
   - ASC/DSC:  the curve where the planet sits on the horizon
               (rising branch = ASC, setting branch = DSC)

          Planetary positions were computed with the open-source <b>astronomy-engine</b> ephemeris (geocentric, true equator

          Astrology, including astrocartography, has no established scientific evidence base — controlled studies haven't
          supported its predictive claims, and no causal mechanism is known. What it does offer is a structured, sky-based
          lens for reflecting on places and what you want from them. Use this map the way the best practitioners suggest:
          as a prompt for attention ("notice how you feel in Paris"), not as a verdict. Don't move, stay, break up, or take
          a job on the strength of a line.
